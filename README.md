# Java Spark Projects

![alt text](spark.png)

This repository contains following Projects

<!-- Project 1 -->
 - Project 1 : It is a simple Java Application, which reads a text csv file and conerts the file into
 ```
 Dataset<Row> object
 ```
    - A Dataset object then gets loaded into PostGreSQL table at the backend.
    - We are also performing trasnformations and actions to understand he difference between the two.
    - How to Datasets are immutable and have to be reassigned once the action has been performed on it was understood.


<!-- Project 2 -->
 - Project 1 : It is a simple Java Application, which reads a text csv file and conerts the file into
 ```
 Dataset<Row> object
 ```
    - A Dataset object then gets loaded into PostGreSQL table at the backend.
